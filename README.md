#Sam Challenge

Hi Sam! Thank you for the oppurtunity. It was fun to get to know Nestjs and work with React again. This project was inspired by quartine bringing out my inner plant mother. The idea is to see how many of each type of plant are sold daily. I know you were thinking to visualize outliers with a scatter plot, but there is a line graph I've done in the past I think you will like. It makes outliers and trends more obvious.

##Controller 

I got a little excited and made CRUD routes for plants. There is a custom route '/plants/:n/getByNumRows' that grabs the number of rows passed in using a SQL query.
